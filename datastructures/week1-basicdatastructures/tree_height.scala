==============
Input:
==============
Explanation:

The input means that there are 5 nodes with numbers from 0 to 4, node 0 is a child of node 4, node 1

is the root, node 2 is a child of node 4, node 3 is a child of node 1 and node 4 is a child of node 1. To

see this, let us write numbers of nodes from 0 to 4 in one line and the numbers given in the input in

the second line underneath:

The height of this tree is 3, because the number of vertices on the path from root 1 to leaf 2 is 3.
0 1 2 3 4

4 -1 4 1 1

Now we can see that the node number 1 is the root, because âˆ’1 corresponds to it in the second line.

Also, we know that the nodes number 3 and number 4 are children of the root node 1. Also, we know

that the nodes number 0 and number 2 are children of the node 4.

4 -1 4 1 1

       root          1

                        /   \
                       0     2
Output:

3

Sample 2.
Explanation:

The input means that there are 5 nodes with numbers from 0 to 4, node 0 is the root, node 1 is a child

of node 0, node 2 is a child of node 4, node 3 is a child of node 0 and node 4 is a child of node 3. The

height of this tree is 4, because the number of vertices on the path from root 0 to leaf 2 is 4.

Input:
